#### The graph above displays the relationship between the goal amount and the campaign's chance of success and failure. 
##### ***NOTE*** - Canceled campaigns aren't displayed since there weren't any for Theatre Plays, canceled information from other campaigns weren't pulled but can be shown if requested.

##### The chart above displays the outcomes based on the launch month starting from October 2010.
###### ***FUN FACT*** - You can filter the graph in the Excel file below. Tab "Outcomes Based on Launch Date", you can filter by Parent Category and then filter the Subcategories as well. If needed, you can also sort through specific years starting from 2010.

### ***CONCLUSION***
#### - After reviewing the Outcomes based on Goals chart, you will have a 76% chance of being successful when having a goal of less than $1,000; second highest chance of being successful will be having a goal greater than or equal to $1,000 and less than $4,999 which is a 73% chance of being successful. If you're willing to roll the dice a bit more, you have a 67% chance of being successful by having a goal greater than or equal to $35,000 and less than or equal to $44,999. On the flip side, you have a 94% chance (average of $45,000 - $49,999 and >= $50,0000 range) of failing if your goal is greater than or equal to $45,000.

#### - Per the outcomes based on launch date chart, notice that this chart is specifically for all subcategories within the theater category, but you can access the speadsheet above and take a deeper look into the specific subcategory numbers. The greatest chance at having a successful outcome is starting your campaign midway through April or midway through July. The month of May has the highest number of successful outcomes and it declines after that until September. Overall, it seems like less campaigns are started at the beginning/end of the year; more than likely due to the holiday season. October and December have the highest chance to failed launches with an average of failing rate of 45%.

#### - However, a limitation of this dataset is that it's not specific enough. While we can pull data for theater, music, games, food, etc. It would be extra beneficial to know the specific sub-subcategory. Theater for example, plays are the subcategory, but what sub-subcategory do those plays represent? Classical, action, humor? You will still have to choose what genre your play will be about, you don't want to have a play that people aren't interested in. That seems the be the biggest flaw with this dataset, it lumps all subcategories into the same sub-subcategory when not all plays are the same.
